# Utils

Utility functions for the NovAda website.

## Modules

- **`animations.ts`** - Animation constants and utilities (transitions, scales, hover states)
- **`canvas.ts`** - Canvas rendering for grid-based content
- **`conway.ts`** - Conway's Game of Life simulation logic

## Key Patterns

- Pure functions with explicit return types
- Double buffering for Conway simulation (performance)
- Grid offsets for fine-tuned alignment
